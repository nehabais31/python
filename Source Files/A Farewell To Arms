qIn the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.
The plain was rich with crops; there were many orchids of fruit trees and beyond the plain the mountains were brown ad bare. There was fighting in the mountains and at night we could see the flases from the artillery. In the dark it was like summer lightning, but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling of a storm coming.
